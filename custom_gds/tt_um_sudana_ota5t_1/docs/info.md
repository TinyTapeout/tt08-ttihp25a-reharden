## How it works

Apply a VDD of 1.8V and VSS ground. 
Then apply a 1uA current to BIAS pin.
Then apply 0.9V to MINUS pin, while applying a voltage of 0-1.8V on PLUS pin in 10mV steps. 
Observe the DIFFOUT pin and check that DIFFOUT shoots up to 1.8V when PLUS is greater than MINUS by 10mV. 
## How to test

Observe the DIFFOUT pin and check that DIFFOUT shoots up to 1.8V when PLUS is greater than MINUS by 10mV. 
     

## External hardware
Power Supply, Sourcemeter for currents, Multimeter to measure voltage.
